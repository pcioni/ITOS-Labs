2. A license determines how your software may be used by other people. It is essentially a way to reserve certain powers when releasing your software. Thereofre, it is also a way to prevent certain activites related to your work related to distribution and modification. A license also protects you legally when releasing your software as open source / public domain.


3. If a product does not have a license, you open yourself to some potential legal struggers with the author. For instance, the author can claim copyright infringement and state that you stole their work. Or, if you make any money off of a modification, they can claim you owe them damages for theft. In addition, it's morally ambiguous to support software that can't even be bothered to apply a license, and reinforces a bad practice.

4. I agree with the overall claim, but one part in particular specifically. "They decided that they would decide what the "right thing" was, instead of unleashing these decisions on others." This is the most frustrating part of using closed-source software: developers deciding what I want and need, instead of just asking me or letting me decide.

5. The .NET core uses the MIT license as a forward-protection license. Since .NET is a framework, it's original intent is to be distributed. However, they need to ensure that future users of the framework do not tack-on .NET and claim modification without copyright attribution, leaving the code vulnerable to theft.

6. Project: an open-source phone app that aggregates estimated delivery times for pizza joints.
   License: MIT license, as users may want to take the underlying systems and apply them to different domains.
   
7. The Apache License is best for a company, as the retention of trademark rights ensures the protection of a brand. For a developer, GPL is good as users cannot sublicense modifications of your work, allowing you to retain your development rights as a copyright holder. For the common good, LGPL is good, as content created using the software may be sublicensed out, so long as the original software is cited and licensed properly, allowing for a wide proliferation of software under one license. 

9. VR development is a pain to work on since the developer has to constantly put on and take off the headset. I was thinking of making a toolkit to help streamline development for VR applications, providing tools such as "recorded actions", "IPS control", and other editor tools. Consumers will be VR developers , specifically for Unity. I would use the MIT license. Since this projet is a bit complex, I've also considered making a log program for video game players to track their games in completeness, time played, and other statistics. People like me play a lot of games of a lot of styles (board games, video games, card games) and keeping track of what Ive played with some numbers of how much I enjoyed the game, etc. would be interesting.
