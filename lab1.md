1.  I've always found it useful to answer questions in a way that make a lack of knowledge appear as a misunderstanding,
rather than a failure of understanding. Sometimes, asking for clarification is the same as saying "I don't know" instead of "I 
sort of know", but there's no need to acknowledge that; just answer the question as if the person asking misunderstood rather than
failed to understand.

2. Also, try to relate the question to something the asker knows well. Asking a question is sort of like admitting a weakness in a 
topic, so try to ground their confidence by relating to something they already understand.

Basically, the RIAA sucks. American IP laws have a long history of dishing out draconian punishment for victimless crimes, minus walets. The RPI network search engine was basically just a data aggregator. It didn't endorse or advise piracy, and only served as a platform for users. However, since users could use the platform for illegal doings, they were shut down. In that same context, I could sue the USA Traffic Authority for allowing drug dealers to drive contraband of roads that I've payed for with taxes. It's a very poor precedent for the Government to be able to viciously attack inventors for not being gods capable of choosing who uses their product and for what reason.



Recently, I've been thinking with my friends about a Pick-Up-Group (PuG) website for the game Overwatch. Currently, Overwatch does not feature a method for players to privately create teams in a controlled environment. The only alternative is matchmaking, which is random. Weve been tinkering around with Go and React.JS to see if a website can be thrown together to help people find pick-up games.
