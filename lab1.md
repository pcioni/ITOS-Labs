1.  I've always found it useful to answer questions in a way that make a lack of knowledge appear as a misunderstanding,
rather than a failure of understanding. Sometimes, asking for clarification is the same as saying "I don't know" instead of "I 
sort of know", but there's no need to acknowledge that; just answer the question as if the person asking misunderstood rather than
failed to understand.

2. Also, try to relate the question to something the asker knows well. Asking a question is sort of like admitting a weakness in a 
topic, so try to ground their confidence by relating to something they already understand. 




Recently, I've been thinking with my friends about a Pick-Up-Group (PuG) website for the game Overwatch. Currently, Overwatch does not feature a method for players to privately create teams in a controlled environment. The only alternative is matchmaking, which is random. Weve been tinkering around with Go and React.JS to see if a website can be thrown together to help people find pick-up games.
