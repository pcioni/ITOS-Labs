C.2
1.  I've always found it useful to answer questions in a way that make a lack of knowledge appear as a misunderstanding,
rather than a failure of understanding. Sometimes, asking for clarification is the same as saying "I don't know" instead of "I 
sort of know", but there's no need to acknowledge that; just answer the question as if the person asking misunderstood rather than
failed to understand.

2. Also, try to relate the question to something the asker knows well. Asking a question is sort of like admitting a weakness in a 
topic, so try to ground their confidence by relating to something they already understand.
